[TL;DR](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr): You need to use your
[client ID and secret from developer.paypal.com](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications)
to get a token to call InitializeMerchant within the SDK. You can use our modules in your own server
(node.js express/Kraken, ruby, Java, .Net, ...), or use one of our prebuilt Docker containers or
Heroku builds (most of this is aspirational right now). You can do this for free on Heroku and Amazon EC2,
including SSL if you use something like [CloudFlare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/).

If you just want to know the gory details of what's happening at the network level, see [What's Really Going On Here?](#whats-really-going-on-here).

Once you have your [developer account on PayPal.com](https://developer.paypal.com), to get started with this Node version, deploy it to Heroku by clicking the button below and then configure the environment variables in the Heroku dashboard.

Usually you're in one of these two situations:

* [First Party](#first-party) - The account I made the PayPal.com developer application with is the only one I ever want to transact with. You will use this server to get a token and then you will put that token in your app.
* [Third Party](#third-party) - I want other merchants to use my application with their own accounts and give me permission to transact for them. You will call this server from your app to get a URL for PayPal Login, then when login completes this server will call APP_REDIRECT_URL as described above.

Why can't I just put the id and secret in the app?
==================================================
PayPal uses [OAuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) to authenticate an application's ability to transact on behalf of a merchant account.
OAuth has three main "sensitive quantities" - the access token, the refresh token and the application secret. The access token is short lived (typically 15 minutes-8 hours)
and useful only for a single account. A refresh token is long lived (by spec 10 years, in theory forever, in practice until the owner revokes it) and useful only
for a single account. The application secret is permanent for a given application and useful for potentially all accounts.

Generally, it's ok to store the access token on the end-user (e.g. mobile) device. You should still store it securely, not record it in logs, etc, but it's value is short lived.
The refresh token should not generally live on the end-user device because it takes away another choke point for you to disable the use of your application in case the device is
lost or stolen (because you could just "invalidate" the refresh token for that account and then that device, the next time it came to your server to refresh the token would not get a
new access token).

The application secret should never live on the end-user device because anyone who has that can infinitely refresh access tokens given refresh
tokens, and can get an access token for YOUR account any time they want. More importantly, anyone holding the application secret can pretend to be your
app and have an unsuspecting user give the rogue app an access and refresh token (by logging into PayPal and believing they are granting permission to your app).

So our recommended approach is to use our server modules or containers to create a server that stores your application secret and provides access tokens to your end user devices.
Our modules also employ an additional server-only password to return a "modified refresh token" to the end user device which means you don't need a database. When your application
needs a new access token, it calls the server module and provides the modified refresh token. The server module combines that with the application secret and calls the PayPal
servers to obtain a new access token which it delivers back to the client.

Note that if you needed to make calls OUTSIDE of your application (such as from your backend services), you would need to get the access token/refresh token flow working on your
backend services and would then need a database to store relevant user data. Doing so securely is outside of the scope of this document, but each server module readme describes
the API, and there's no reason you can't use the same services for your other backend services.

First Party
===========
You can go through the Login With PayPal flow and grant consent to your application just once. The token returned will include the
"modified refresh token" that can be baked into your application and shipped. The server modules and containers we provide expose an
endpoint for first party token creation (/setup) that can be disabled after you generate the original value. The point of the additional
identifier (the APP_SECURE_IDENTIFIER, which you can just make up) is in the case where you have an application compromise or significant bug, you can change
this identifier and applications with the old value will stop being able to transact on your behalf. Essentially this identifier is
a remote kill switch that you control.

Third Party
===========
Within this scheme there is another big question - do you have your own account system or do you want to use PayPal for
all authentication? If you have your own account system, it's very likely you want to use our server modules instead of
the standalone containers. In that case you would first authenticate the API caller against your own system, and verify
the link between that account and the PayPal account before obtaining access tokens on their behalf. This provides an
additional layer of security and control for end user applications making calls for your merchants via your app.

Note: You MUST set the redirect URL of your app on developer.paypal.com to match the server to which you deploy the paypal-retail-node code with the path /returnFromPayPal appended. For example, if you've deployed to http://pph-retail-node.herokuapp.com, the return URL MUST be set to http://pph-retail-node.herokuapp.com/returnFromPayPal

What's Really Going On Here?
============================

Fundamentally, this application manages your client id and client secret in order to generate access tokens on behalf of a merchant (which could be the same account).
These access tokens are in turn used by your application to call certain PayPal services on behalf of the merchant. The services which you can call are determined by
the **scopes** you request during token creation. The first time you want to generate an access token for an account,
you must send them to PayPal.com to login and consent to the scopes you request. This is accomplished by the */toPayPal*
endpoint in [server.js](server.js) and in turn the *redirect* method in this module (which you would use if integrating into your own node.js server). For example, for the
client id ABCDEFG which is registered with developer.paypal.com as having a return url of http://abcdefg.com/returnFromPayPal, you would send your merchant to

````
https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/webapps/auth/protocol/openidconnect/v1/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=ABCDEFG&scope=openid+email+phone+profile+address+https://uri.paypal.com/services/paypalhere+https://api.paypal.com/v1/payments/.*+https://uri.paypal.com/services/paypalattributes/business&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fabcdefg.com%2FreturnFromPayPal&state=something_you_need_to_get_back
````

The redirect_uri must match the URL registered on your application details page on the [PayPal developer site](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications) EXACTLY.
If you need to pass additional information that will be returned to your application post-login, use the state parameter. This implementation uses the state parameter to
remember which environment you're trying to login to (e.g. sandbox or live).

Once login is complete, PayPal will send the merchant's browser back to the redirect_uri with an *authorization code*. The URL would be something like:

````
http://abcdefg.com/returnFromPayPal?state=something_you_need_to_get_back&scope=some_scopes&code=THE_CODE_FROM_PAYPAL
````

You must take that authorization code and submit it to PayPal, along with your client id and secret, to retrieve the *access token* 
and *refresh token*. This is handled by the */returnFromPayPal* endpoint in [server.js](server.js) or the *completeAuthentication* method 
in the module. In reality, this is an HTTPS POST to the token endpoint (https://api.paypal.com/v1/identity/openidconnect/tokenservice) with the following URL-encoded form body:

````
grant_type=authorization_code&code=THE_CODE_FROM_PAYPAL&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fabcdefg.com%2FreturnFromPayPal
````

This should return the access and refresh tokens:

````
{ scope: 'https://uri.paypal.com/services/paypalattributes/business phone https://uri.paypal.com/services/paypalhere https://api.paypal.com/v1/payments/.* address email openid profile',
  nonce: 'SOME_RANDOM_STUFF',
  access_token: 'A_LONG_CODE',
  token_type: 'Bearer',
  expires_in: 28800,
  refresh_token: 'A_LONGER_CODE'
}
 ````
 
You then make requests using this access token until it expires. Once it expires (which is indicated by an error telling you so),
you should call the refresh endpoint (https://api.paypal.com/v1/oauth2/token) with the client id and secret in the
Authorization header and the refresh token in the body:
 
````
grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=A_LONGER_CODE&scope=https://uri.paypal.com/services/paypalattributes/business+phone+https://uri.paypal.com/services/paypalhere+https://api.paypal.com/v1/payments/.*+address+email+openid+profile
````

And that's all there is to making PayPal API requests using access tokens.
